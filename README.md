# About the simulation
We will simulate the sales in a B2C coffee home-delivery subscription servive. 

### Why simulate?
The purpose is learning through playing with the answers of the service provider as simulated data comes in.

### Why this company?
- everyone can imagine this company
- client segments can be wildly different
- consequently the adequate answers too

### How?
I will create a number of customer segments with a realistic distribution of preferences, values, market size, and competitors. The number of these segments and their preferences will be unknown to the person watching the simulation.

Then purchases will start coming in based on the user's initial setup.
