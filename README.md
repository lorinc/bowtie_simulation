# About the simulation
We will simulate the sales in a B2C coffee home-delivery subscription service. 

### Why simulate?
The purpose is simulating the challenges of a sales org. Only know, what you research, and even then, data might be misleading. Yet, you got to ad run campaigns, special offers, launch new productlines and improve your revenue.

### Why this company?
- everyone can imagine this company
- client segments can be wildly different
- consequently the adequate answers too

### How?
I will create a number of customer segments with a realistic distribution of preferences, values, market size, and competitors. The number of these segments and their preferences will be unknown to the person watching the simulation.

Then purchases will start coming in based on your initial marketing setup, and you must learn as you go
